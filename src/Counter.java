/*
Question: Implement a Counter class that has the following methods:


put(number): put the number to the data structure
count(number): count the number of times number was put during the last window=5 minutes
countAll(): count the number of times any number was put during the last window=5 minutes.
Example:
At t = 10PM, put(2)
At t = 10:02PM, put(2)
At t = 10:03PM, put(3)
At t = 10:04PM, count(2) should return 2
At t = 10:04PM, countAll() should return 3
At t = 10:06PM, count(2) should return 1 (the one that was put at 10:02PM)
At t = 10:06PM, countAll() should return 2


Follow-ups:


If you were to write unit tests, what would they be
If your code was to be in production, what issues may it cause?
