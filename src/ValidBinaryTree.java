/*
Given an undirected acyclic graph with all of the vertices
    having at most 3 neighbors.
    Every vertex is colored either
    in red or black or white.
    Please find a root vertex so that:

    1. It will form a valid binary tree.
    2. Vertices with the same depth are colored with the same color.
    3. Color should be changing
    in R->W->B->R->W->B order as depth increases.
    Please note that R->B->W->R->B->W is not allowed.
    (root can be any color,
    so it can be R->W->B->… or W->B->R->…
    or B->R->W->… starting from root)


    Return -1 if we can’t find such a vertex.
